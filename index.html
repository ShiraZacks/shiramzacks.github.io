                <hr>
                <p>I started out college thinking I would graduate as a social worker. Imagine my surprise when, two
                    years later, the certificate I recieved was for Computer Programming and Web Development!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <img class="column_icon" src="confusedicon.png" alt="Coding Background"
                    name="https://www.flaticon.com/">
                <hr>
                <p>I then realized that just because I know languages like <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>,
                    <span>JavaScript</span>, <span>PHP</span>, <span>SQL</span>, and more, didn't mean I knew how to
                    create a website.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <img class="column_icon" src="computericon.png" alt="Coding Background"
                    name="https://www.flaticon.com/">
                <hr>
                <p>It took a while, but I worked on my skills until I was confident that I could produce an entire
                    website from the bottom up.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <img class="column_icon" src="yesicon.png" alt="Coding Background" name="https://www.flaticon.com/">
                <hr>
                <p>So I did! I was hired to create a website for a small business. It was amazing. I was able to use my
                    skills and have fun, doing what I enjoyed and getting paid for it, too! (It hasn't launched yet,

                <hr>
                <p>Now I am looking foward to moving foward. As I await my next project, I am having fun building
                    projects for myself, and keeping my knowledge up-to-date.</p>

    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
        a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum. It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
        when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
        letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>
